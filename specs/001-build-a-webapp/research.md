# Phase 0: Technical Research - UniApply Hub

**Date**: 2024-10-04  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish architectural decisions

## JWT Token Security Strategy

**Decision**: Implement JWT with refresh token rotation strategy
- Access tokens: 15-minute expiration, stored in memory
- Refresh tokens: 7-day expiration, stored in httpOnly cookies
- Automatic token refresh on API calls

**Rationale**: 
- Short-lived access tokens minimize security risk if compromised
- Refresh token rotation prevents replay attacks
- httpOnly cookies protect against XSS attacks
- Automatic refresh provides seamless user experience

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single long-lived tokens: Rejected due to security risks
- Session-based authentication: Rejected due to scaling limitations
- OAuth integration: Deferred for future enhancement

## Cloud Storage Integration

**Decision**: Use Cloudinary for file uploads and management
- Built-in image/document processing capabilities
- Automatic format optimization and resizing
- CDN delivery for fast file access
- Malware scanning integration available

**Rationale**:
- Simpler integration than AWS S3 for document management
- Built-in security features and validation
- Automatic backup and redundancy
- Cost-effective for expected file volumes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS S3: More complex setup, higher learning curve
- Local file storage: Not scalable for production deployment
- Google Cloud Storage: Similar features but less document-focused

## Real-time Messaging Implementation

**Decision**: Implement polling-based messaging with optional Socket.io upgrade
- Initial implementation: HTTP polling every 30 seconds
- Real-time enhancement: Socket.io for instant notifications
- Graceful degradation for clients without WebSocket support

**Rationale**:
- Polling is simpler to implement and debug
- Meets initial requirements for message delivery
- Socket.io upgrade path available for enhanced UX
- Reduces initial complexity while maintaining scalability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Server-Sent Events: One-way only, not suitable for acknowledgments
- WebRTC: Overkill for simple messaging requirements
- Third-party services: Adds external dependencies and costs

## File Upload Security

**Decision**: Multi-layer file validation and security
- Client-side: File type and size validation
- Server-side: MIME type verification, magic number checking
- Storage: Virus scanning integration with Cloudinary
- Access: Signed URLs with expiration for downloads

**Rationale**:
- Defense in depth approach prevents malicious uploads
- Client validation improves UX with immediate feedback
- Server validation ensures security integrity
- Signed URLs prevent unauthorized file access

**Security Measures**:
- File type whitelist: PDF, DOCX, JPG, PNG only
- Size limits: 10MB maximum per file
- Filename sanitization to prevent directory traversal
- Content-Type header validation
- Regular security audits of uploaded content

## MongoDB Indexing Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive indexing for search and performance
- Universities: Compound index on (country, region, fieldsOfStudy)
- Users: Index on email (unique), sessionId for fast lookups
- Applications: Compound index on (userId, status, submittedDate)
- Messages: Index on (to, timestamp) for inbox queries

**Rationale**:
- Search queries require fast filtering by multiple criteria
- User authentication needs fast email and session lookups
- Application tracking requires efficient status and date queries
- Message retrieval needs optimized inbox performance

**Performance Targets**:
- University search: <100ms for filtered results
- User authentication: <50ms for token validation
- Application queries: <150ms for dashboard data
- Message retrieval: <100ms for inbox loading

## Deployment Architecture

**Decision**: Separate deployments for frontend and backend
- Frontend: Vercel for React application (CDN + SSG benefits)
- Backend: Railway or Render for Node.js API (better than Heroku pricing)
- Database: MongoDB Atlas for managed database service
- File Storage: Cloudinary CDN for global file delivery

**Rationale**:
- Vercel optimizes React deployments with automatic builds
- Railway/Render provide better value than Heroku for API hosting
- MongoDB Atlas handles database scaling and backups
- Separate deployments allow independent scaling

**Environment Configuration**:
- Development: Local MongoDB, local file storage
- Staging: Cloud services with test data
- Production: Full cloud deployment with monitoring

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive testing across all layers
- Unit Tests: Jest for backend business logic (90% coverage target)
- Integration Tests: Supertest for API endpoints
- Component Tests: React Testing Library for UI components
- E2E Tests: Cypress for complete user workflows
- Performance Tests: Artillery for load testing API endpoints

**Test Data Strategy**:
- Seed scripts for university data (100+ institutions)
- Factory functions for test user generation
- Mocked external services (Cloudinary, email)
- Isolated test database for each test run

## Security Implementation

**Decision**: Multi-layer security approach
- Authentication: bcrypt for password hashing, JWT with rotation
- Input Validation: express-validator for all API inputs
- Rate Limiting: express-rate-limit to prevent abuse
- CORS: Configured for frontend domain only
- Headers: helmet.js for security headers

**Security Checklist**:
- All passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Input sanitization on all user data
- SQL injection prevention (MongoDB parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (Content Security Policy headers)
- CSRF protection (SameSite cookies)
- File upload scanning and validation

## Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Frontend and backend optimization strategies
- Frontend: Code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization
- Backend: Connection pooling, query optimization, caching
- Database: Proper indexing, aggregation pipelines
- CDN: Cloudinary for files, Vercel for static assets

**Monitoring Strategy**:
- Performance metrics: Response times, memory usage
- Error tracking: Comprehensive logging and alerting
- User analytics: Page load times, user flow analysis
- Uptime monitoring: Health checks and status pages

## Development Workflow

**Decision**: Constitutional compliance with modern tooling
- Code Quality: ESLint, Prettier for consistent formatting
- Pre-commit Hooks: Husky for running tests and linting
- Documentation: JSDoc comments for all public functions
- API Documentation: OpenAPI specs with Swagger UI

**Quality Gates**:
- All tests must pass before merge
- Code coverage minimum 90%
- ESLint with no warnings
- Security audit with npm audit
- Performance benchmarks met
