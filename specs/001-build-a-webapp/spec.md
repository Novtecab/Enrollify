# Feature Specification: UniApply Hub - University Application Management Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-webapp`  
**Created**: 2024-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a webapp that builds a complete web application called \"UniApply Hub\" using modern technologies: React.js for the frontend (with Tailwind CSS for styling and React Router for navigation), Node.js with Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for the database (using Mongoose for schema management), and JWT for authentication. Ensure the app is responsive, secure (with input validation, file upload limits, and HTTPS considerations), and deployable to platforms like Vercel or Heroku. Include user authentication via email/password signup/login, with unique session IDs generated as JWT tokens stored in localStorage."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Students and prospective university applicants need a centralized platform to manage their academic profiles, store important documents, research universities, submit applications, and track their application progress. Administrators need to monitor application trends, communicate with applicants, and manage the overall application ecosystem.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Student Registration and Profile Management:**
1. **Given** a prospective student visits the platform, **When** they create an account with email and password, **Then** they receive confirmation and can access their personal dashboard
2. **Given** a logged-in student, **When** they complete their profile with academic history, **Then** the system saves their information and shows completion status
3. **Given** a student with an incomplete profile, **When** they attempt to submit an application, **Then** the system prompts them to complete required profile sections

**Document Management:**
4. **Given** a logged-in student, **When** they upload a transcript file, **Then** the system validates file type and size, stores it securely, and shows it in their document library
5. **Given** a student with uploaded documents, **When** they want to download a previously uploaded file, **Then** the system provides secure access to their document

**University Search and Application:**
6. **Given** a student browsing universities, **When** they filter by country and field of study, **Then** the system displays matching universities with relevant program information
7. **Given** a student selecting a university program, **When** they submit an application with required documents, **Then** the system creates an application record with "Draft" status
8. **Given** a submitted application, **When** the deadline passes, **Then** the system automatically updates the status and notifies relevant parties

**Administrative Oversight:**
9. **Given** an admin user, **When** they access the statistics dashboard, **Then** they see current metrics about user registrations, applications, and regional distribution
10. **Given** an admin reviewing applications, **When** they update an application status, **Then** the system logs the change and notifies the applicant

**Communication System:**
11. **Given** an admin, **When** they send a message to a specific student, **Then** the student receives the message in their inbox with notification
12. **Given** a student with unread messages, **When** they log in, **Then** they see a notification indicator and can access their message inbox

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to upload a file larger than the size limit?
- How does the system handle expired authentication sessions?
- What occurs when a user attempts to apply to the same program twice?
- How does the system respond when the document storage service is unavailable?
- What happens if a user tries to submit an application after the deadline?
- How does the system handle concurrent admin status updates on the same application?
