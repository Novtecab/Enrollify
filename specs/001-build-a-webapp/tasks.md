- **Phase 3.9-3.12 (Integration & Polish)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Total Estimated Duration**: 6-10 weeks for full implementation

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: Each API endpoint → contract test + implementation task
2. **From Data Model**: Each entity → model creation + service + route tasks  
3. **From User Stories**: Each workflow → integration test + UI component tasks
4. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Routes → Frontend → Integration → Documentation
5. **Parallel Marking**: Tasks affecting different files marked [P] for parallel execution
