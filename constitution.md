# UniApply Hub Development Constitution

## Code Quality Principles

### 1. Code Standards
- **Language Consistency**: All JavaScript code must use ES2022+ features consistently
- **Type Safety**: Implement proper input validation and type checking at API boundaries
- **Code Style**: Follow standardized formatting with ESLint and Prettier
- **Documentation**: Every function and API endpoint must have clear JSDoc comments
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages

### 2. Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with proper expiration and refresh mechanisms
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs must be sanitized and validated server-side
- **File Security**: File uploads limited to 10MB, with type validation and malware scanning considerations
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data must be properly hashed (bcrypt for passwords)
- **HTTPS**: All production deployments must use HTTPS
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints must implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 3. Performance Standards
- **Database Optimization**: MongoDB queries must use proper indexing
- **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- **Bundle Size**: Frontend bundles must be optimized and code-split appropriately
- **API Response Time**: API endpoints must respond within 500ms for 95% of requests
- **File Handling**: Large file uploads must use streaming and progress indicators

## Testing Standards

### 1. Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% code coverage for business logic
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints must have integration tests
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user flows must be covered by E2E tests
- **Security Tests**: Input validation and authentication flows must be tested

### 2. Test Quality
- **Test Isolation**: Tests must be independent and not rely on external state
- **Mock Strategy**: External dependencies must be properly mocked
- **Test Data**: Use factories and fixtures for consistent test data
- **Continuous Testing**: Tests must run on every commit via CI/CD

## User Experience Consistency

### 1. Design Principles
- **Responsive Design**: Application must work seamlessly on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all user interfaces
- **Loading States**: All async operations must show appropriate loading indicators
- **Error States**: User-friendly error messages with clear recovery actions
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Consistent theming support across all components

### 2. User Journey Standards
- **Navigation**: Intuitive navigation with clear breadcrumbs and state indicators
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **File Management**: Clear upload progress, file preview, and management capabilities
- **Session Management**: Graceful handling of session expiration with user notifications
- **Offline Resilience**: Graceful degradation when network connectivity is poor

### 3. Admin Experience
- **Dashboard Clarity**: Key metrics displayed with appropriate visualizations
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient tools for managing multiple applications/users
- **Audit Trail**: All admin actions must be logged for accountability
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates for application status changes and new submissions

## Performance Requirements

### 1. Frontend Performance
- **Initial Load Time**: Application must load within 3 seconds on 3G networks
- **Runtime Performance**: 60fps animations and smooth scrolling
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management to prevent memory leaks
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical features

### 2. Backend Performance
- **Database Performance**: Queries optimized with proper indexing strategies
- **API Efficiency**: RESTful APIs with efficient data serialization
- **File Processing**: Asynchronous file processing to prevent blocking
- **Scalability**: Architecture must support horizontal scaling

### 3. Infrastructure Requirements
- **Deployment**: Support for both Vercel (frontend) and Heroku/Railway (backend)
- **Environment Management**: Proper environment variable management
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring and error tracking
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups with restore procedures

## Data Integrity and Privacy

### 1. Data Management
- **Schema Validation**: Mongoose schemas with comprehensive validation
- **Data Consistency**: Transactions for multi-document operations
- **Backup Procedures**: Regular automated backups with tested restore procedures
- **Data Migration**: Versioned migration scripts for schema changes

### 2. Privacy Protection
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary user data
- **Consent Management**: Clear consent mechanisms for data collection
- **Data Retention**: Defined retention policies for user data
- **Right to Deletion**: Implement user data deletion capabilities

## Development Workflow

### 1. Code Review Standards
- **Peer Review**: All code changes require peer review before merging
- **Security Review**: Security-sensitive changes require additional security review
- **Performance Review**: Performance-critical changes require performance validation
- **Documentation Review**: Documentation must be updated with code changes

### 2. Deployment Standards
- **Staging Environment**: All changes must be tested in staging before production
- **Rolling Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment strategies
- **Rollback Procedures**: Quick rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health check endpoints for monitoring

This constitution serves as the foundation for all development decisions and must be referenced when making technical choices throughout the project lifecycle.
