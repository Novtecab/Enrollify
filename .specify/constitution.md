# UniApply Hub Constitution

## Project Principles

### Code Quality Standards
- **Clean Code**: Write self-documenting code with meaningful variable and function names
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate concerns using clear separation between frontend, backend, and database layers
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established patterns for authentication, error handling, and API design
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript where possible and implement proper validation
- **Security First**: Implement secure coding practices including input validation, authentication, and authorization

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Testing**: All critical business logic must have unit tests with minimum 80% coverage
- **Integration Testing**: API endpoints must have integration tests
- **Error Handling**: Test both success and failure scenarios
- **Test Organization**: Tests should mirror the source code structure
- **Continuous Testing**: Tests must pass before code deployment

### User Experience Consistency
- **Responsive Design**: All interfaces must work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for accessibility
- **Consistent UI/UX**: Use standardized components, colors, fonts, and spacing throughout
- **Loading States**: Provide clear feedback during loading, processing, and error states
- **User Feedback**: Implement intuitive notifications, error messages, and success confirmations

### Performance Requirements
- **Page Load Times**: Initial page load must complete within 3 seconds
- **API Response Times**: API endpoints must respond within 1 second for data queries
- **Database Optimization**: Use proper indexing and query optimization
- **File Upload Efficiency**: Support progressive upload with proper validation and size limits
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching for static assets and frequently accessed data

### Security Principles
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication with proper token management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for admin and user functions
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **File Security**: Implement secure file upload with type and size validation

### Development Workflow
- **Version Control**: Use descriptive commit messages and branching strategy
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes must be reviewed before merging
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date README, API documentation, and code comments
- **Environment Management**: Separate development, staging, and production configurations
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment pipeline with rollback capability

### Technology Stack Compliance
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js 18+ with Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure storage
- **File Storage**: Cloud-based storage (AWS S3 or Cloudinary)
- **Testing**: Jest for unit testing, Supertest for API testing

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design APIs to be stateless and scalable
- **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing and connection pooling
- **File Management**: Use cloud storage for scalable file handling
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with proper pagination and filtering
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for production systems

### Compliance and Standards
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for user data handling
- **API Standards**: Follow REST API best practices
- **Error Codes**: Use standard HTTP status codes
- **Logging**: Implement structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular automated backups of critical data
